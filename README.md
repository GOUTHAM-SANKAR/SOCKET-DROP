# SocketDrop - The "Useless" File Transfer App 🎯

## Basic Details
### Team Name: [TRON]

### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Goutham Sankar] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT PUNNAPRA]
- Member 2: [JAYASOORIA K] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT PUNNAPRA]

### Project Description
A peer-to-peer file sharing web application that lets you instantly transfer files, images, videos, and messages across devices without any setup or signup - because apparently we needed another way to share files when we already have email, USB drives, cloud storage, and carrier pigeons!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Why use simple solutions like email attachments or cloud storage when you can create a complex peer-to-peer WebRTC application to share a single photo between your phone and laptop? Who needs the reliability of established file sharing methods when you can have the thrill of wondering if your connection will work?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built SocketDrop - a web application that uses WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer file transfers! Features include:
- Cross-platform file sharing via web browser
- Real-time device discovery on local networks
- Device pairing for permanent connections
- Multiple theme options (because aesthetics > functionality)
- Support for text messages, images, and files
- QR code sharing (for that modern touch)
- Progressive Web App capabilities

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSocket (ws), WebRTC
- **Dependencies:** 
  - express-rate-limit (because we're fancy)
  - ua-parser-js (to judge your browser choice)
  - unique-names-generator (for creative device names)
  - heic2any (iOS compatibility, because Apple)
- **Build Tools:** Node.js with ES modules

### Implementation
For Software:

# Installation
```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone (https://github.com/GOUTHAM-SANKAR/SOCKET-DROP)


# Install the "essential" dependencies
npm install
```

# Run
```bash
# Start the server (and pray it works)
npm start

# Or run with production optimizations
npm run start:prod
```

### Project Demo
# Video
[View my files on Jumpshare](https://jumpshare.com/folder/F2KsvI3x1olE7dfMtxL5)


*Demonstration of cross-device file sharing, device pairing, and the various theme options that definitely make this project worthwhile*

# Additional Demos
- Live deployment: https://socket-drop-bay.vercel.app/   https://socket-drop.onrender.com/
- Test the QR code pairing feature
- Try different themes (because priorities)

## Features That Make This "Useless"
- ✅ Works perfectly when both devices are on the same network (revolutionary!)
- ✅ Requires both devices to have the web app open simultaneously
- ✅ Uses WebRTC (because simple HTTP uploads are too mainstream)
- ✅ Multiple themes to choose from (essential for file transfer apps)
- ✅ Device names like "Purple Elephant" and "Dancing Banana"
- ✅ QR codes for pairing (because typing is hard)
- ✅ Progressive Web App support (for that native feel)
- ✅ Real-time connection status (watching dots is fun)

## Why This Exists
Because the world clearly needed another file sharing solution! Forget about:
- Email attachments (too reliable)
- Google Drive/Dropbox (too convenient)
- USB drives (too physical)
- AirDrop (too limited to Apple devices)
- Bluetooth (too slow)

Instead, enjoy the complexity of WebRTC connections, the excitement of network discovery, and the satisfaction of knowing your files are traveling directly between devices through the magical internet tubes!

## Team Contributions
- [Goutham Sankar]: Backend development, WebRTC implementation,,Frontend UI/UX, theme development, convincing team this was necessary, existential crisis about project usefulness
- [Jayasooria]: WebSocket integration, progressive web app features, finding creative ways to justify this project
